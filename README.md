# a-letter
this letter is towards no one in particular. if you’re reading this it means I genuinely cannot see myself living for much longer and so I have decided to tell my nurse. I don’t know how anything’s going to happen, or if she’ll even believe me. content warning for suicide and intrusive thoughts.
