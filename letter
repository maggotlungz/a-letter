I am fourteen now, which is an age I didn't really think I'd reach. Things are far out of my control and have been for some time now. I donâ€™t
know who I am, what I like, or who I love. Time is something I cannot conceptualize, life blurs past me. Mocking me. There are parts of me
that wish to stay alive until the end of time itself and there are parts of me that cannot handle this anymore. I have died a very long time
ago when I was a barely a child. Slaughtered, the remains of who I used to be and who I could've been are nothing but mutilated thoughts.
Such anger fills me now, the kind that makes pretty people into dead corpses hanging from trees. Truly, have I been brought upon this Earth 
to have nothing but anger? I wish I wasn't like this. but that is nothing more than wishful thinking and dreams that could never come true.
I have been told that I am a wonderful person who sill do wonderful things when I am older but now the thought of growing older makes me feel
violently sick. I don't want to grow older. I want nothing more than to hold scalpels and mutilate myself until I drop dead, to scream and 
cry out in such excruciating pain. I want to hang myself with a ragged noose, my own blood and spit filling up my throat as I choke. The days
and months feel like they're repeating themselves, over and over again the cycle continues until I cannot bare another moment, so then I 
cut my flesh open and watch the blood poor out. I am so tired it hurts. I have no strength left in me, only violent anger. I am so sorry to
the younger version of myself, who was so full of energy and happiness and love. I'm so sorry that my head is filled with such intrusive,
I'm so sorry that I have permanetly scarred our body, I am so sorry I have no love for ourself. Perhaps this is the end and perhaps this is
not. Suffering like this is not poetic or beautiful and you deserve better. I'm so sorry, you sweet angel, for I cannot carry on anymore.
